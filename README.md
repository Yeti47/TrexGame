# T-Rex Runner (MonoGame implementation)
A recreation of the T-Rex Runner game from Google Chrome, developed for a YouTube series of mine using the MonoGame framework and .NET core. All credits for the original game go to the Chromium team.

## Description
This is a MonoGame implementation of the T-Rex Runner game that is hidden as an easteregg in the Google Chrome browser. It is implemented with C# and .NET core and was designed to be as close to the original as possible. This game was developed for a YouTube tutorial series, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG2i_rSSIXXoFdh3WCDtGumklyIXt4KiY).
